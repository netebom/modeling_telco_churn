# Customer Churn Analysis 
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as acquiring new customers is often more costly than retaining existing ones. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain customers and improve overall satisfaction.


## PROJECT TITLE
CHURN PREDICTION AND ANALYSIS : Leveraging Machine Learning for Customer Retention

## OBJECTIVE
- Learn more about classification models and help the client, a telecommunication company, to understand their data.
- Find the lifetime value of each customer. know what factors affect the rate at which customers stop using their network.
- Predict if a customer will churn or not based on the Payment method.

## GOAL
- To develop predictive models that forecast the likelihood of individual customers churning in the future
- Enabling proactive intervention strategies to retain at-risk customers and maximize customer retention

## Data Sources:
The datasets where extracted from three(3) places.

- First dataset - First 3000 records of the dataset was extracted from Microsoft SQL Server
- Second dataset - The second 2000 records of the dataset was downloaded from GitHub Repository
- Third dataset - The third part of the data was downloaded from a OneDrive (Test Data)

## Hypothesis
- H0: Payment methods does not significantly influence customer churn 
- H1: Payment methods significantly influence customer churn

## Conclusion on Hypothesis
The Chi-Square statistic of 433.207 and the extremely small p-value, we have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. This means there is a significant association between payment methods and churn. Therefore, we conclude that payment methods significantly influence churn.


## Research Questions
### BUSINESS QUESTIONS  

  - What is the gender dynamics in Churn?
  - How does tenure affect Churn?
  - Which gender uses StreamingTV service more?
  - How are gender and tenure distributed among customers, and what impact do these factors have on customer churn?
